# Capstone-Assignment
The client requested an online version of their application
<br>
The request was for no CSS as they will add their own CSS from their site
The form goes through the different information they request of applicants then stores that in a database
It starts with the background.php file
This uses html,javascript and some CSS when needed for javascript
